# FAQ

**Q:** How do I obtain my trainer icon?

> Log in to the [Pokémon Global Link](https://3ds.pokemon-gl.com/), register/sync your game and right-click the icon to save it.

**Q:** How do I rename my tabs?

> Double click on your tab's name. Add one of the following prefixes to have your tabs sorted: "FT:" (For Trade), "LF:" (Looking For), or "NFT:" (Not For Trade). Additionally, you may add the "!:" prefix to hide your tab altogether.

**Q:** Is there a way to hide one of my tabs?

> Yes! If a tab starts with the "!:" prefix it will be ignored.

**Q:** How do I mark an IV as even/odd?

> For odd IVs, you can write "2x+1" or "O." For even IVs, input "2x" or "E."

**Q:** Is there a way to mark Hyper Training?

> Yes! When filling your Pokémon's IVs, you may write "HT" or (if you want to be more specific) a number followed by "\*" (e.g., "27\*").

**Q:** How do I mark an ability as hidden?

> The script recognizes hidden abilities automatically and applies italics to them. Do note though that this relies on the Pokédex number being correct so make sure to not mess with the formula on the first column. If the dex number is not showing up, copy/drag the Google Sheets formula from another cell.

> Some Pokémon have no HA in their current form but may obtain it through evolution (e.g., Ferroseed, Metapod) or maybe had it previously (e.g., Flygon, Alolan Raichu). To mark these special cases, you may add an "\*" at the end of the ability's name (e.g., "Surge Surfer\*").
